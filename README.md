# gitea-user-keys-idor

**Gitea** `1.27.3` - Gitea

[`GET /api/v1/user/keys/{id}`](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/blob/v1.27.3/routers/api/v1/user/key.go) sits in the current-user group (`reqToken`, `rejectPublicOnly`). The handler still loads the row by numeric ID with **no owner check**. The same table holds user keys, **deploy keys**, and principals. GPG's sibling does it right: `GetGPGKeyForUserByID(ctx, ctx.Doer.ID, id)`. Private fields are gated. The **public key material, title, and fingerprint are not**. IDs are sequential.

**A `read:user` token walks `1`, `2`, `3` and inventories other people's SSH and deploy keys. Open registration makes that a new-account bug.**

## What an attacker can do

Register (default open registration), mint a `read:user` token, walk `/api/v1/user/keys/{id}`. They get titles, fingerprints, and public key material for keys they do not own, including deploy keys. They do not get the private key. They do not get a shell. They inventory who has access to what.

The 1.27.3 key GHSA was username-scoped list plus `individualPermsChecker`. It was not this lookup.

Same tag leftover: [git HTTP redirect SSRF](https://github.com/abraxas/gitea-git-redir-ssrf).

## How I found it

v1.27.3 closed the 2026 GHSA wave. I sat on that tag anyway and read the current-user key handler next to GPG. GPG 404s a foreign id. SSH does not.

`seed.sh` plants victim key title `GHSA-GITEA-KEY-IDOR-WITNESS` and an attacker key. Attacker's own list does not contain the witness. `GET /user/keys/1` as the attacker does. GPG with a foreign id 404s. That is the whole argument.

Wrong turns already recorded: treating the attacker's own list as the leak (it is not - list is scoped, GET-by-id is not); a reverse shell. Theatre.

Client bugs look like product bugs. A helper that shadows `http.client` never sends a packet. `.recv()` on an `HTTPResponse` is not `.read()`. I mention that once because it cost time and looked, for a minute, like 1.27.3 had finished the job.

## Lab

```bash
cd lab
./run.sh
```

Target **only** `http://127.0.0.1:18101`.

```text
add-key user=victim status=201 title=GHSA-GITEA-KEY-IDOR-WITNESS id=1
add-key user=attacker status=201 id=2
attacker-list status=200 ids=[2] (no witness)
get id=1 status=200 snippet contains GHSA-GITEA-KEY-IDOR-WITNESS
SUCCESS Gitea #1 user/keys IDOR
```

## The fix

404 unless `key.OwnerID == ctx.Doer.ID` (or site admin). Reject deploy/principal types. Match GPG.
